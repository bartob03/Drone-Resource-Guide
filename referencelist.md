## Basis for comparison ##

- user-generated geographic content (UGGC)
- open source GIS
- community mapping
- ppgis
- 

Journals can step back and study volunteered geographic information and participatory GIS but detachment means they are separate from the data and fail to realize its real-world significance. Over-reliance on other sources and lack of interactivity with the map data itself limits journal writers understanding of subtle experiences involved with UGGC. Briefly working with community mapping is not the same as dedicating long hours writing code and using map editing tools and crafting minute map details. Regardless of the complexity of the map features, a brief journal article fails to describe the overall process and interactions involved.

## OSM Review ##

The OSM community has many characteristics of social media groups and technical forums. However, in terms of its growth and maturity as an online organization, is advanced and has some features that are not found in more shallow online communities such as those found in Reddit and Instagram. 

Here are a few activities and content found in OSM that distinguishes itself from other information communities:

- OSM promotes Mapping weekend events, meetups, and micro mapping parties.
- OSM distributes flyers and posters, and freely provides material for producing them.
- various interactive support channels such as mailing lists, helpdesks, Internet Relay Chat access, Twitter contacts, and forums
- Organizes formal and informal events such as State of the Map conferences and developer Hackathons
- Accepts donations 

Hours/Day of the event: Social media posts or breaking news
Days/Weeks after event: New stories, social media, blog posts, magazine articles, secondary new stories, forum posts, etc.



## CaGIS Overview ##

The Cartography and Geographic Information Science (CaGIS) journal is a publication that focuses on current map usage and developments in the geospatial study and industry. The journal is distributed worldwide and serves as a platform for the exchange of ideas regarding cartography, geography, and related sciences.

## CaGIS Review ##

The output of the Cartography and Geographic Information Science journal that is practical for real-world, live digital mapping is limited. In comparison to regular, unregulated, but practical articles published in community sources, the journal articles are abstract and often purely academic. Since access to the journal is limited to subscribers, professional bodies or educational bodies, it never has any impact on today's dedicated albeit amateur mappers. Like many journals, the content is limited to its owns sphere of influence, and although its impact on the geospatial industry eventually trickles down to real users and professionals, it doesn't nearly have the same impact as data and contributions made by exceptional developers and enthusiastic mappers using their own resources and equipment.

The articles in the journal are edited and scholarly, but the writing style is inaccessible and the content is often disconnected from how mapping and cartography are done in commercial companies with robust resources such as HERE, TomTom, and Google. To be fair, the contributors probably don't have access to the financial and technological resources of these huge enterprises. On the other hand, hobbyists, amateur cartographers, and students who are outside the sphere of influence, as demonstrated by freely available content in OpenStreetMaps.org, provide meaningful data that is equal to, if not superior, to the findings reported in the journal. Moreover, the live content in community resources, though curated, edited, and vetted only to a limited extent, can be described as skating the rim of cutting edge, whereas the journal's release and characteristically slow publishing cycle limits its relevance during a time when technology moves and changes quickly within a short period of time.

The journal articles often feels meditative, theoretical, and analytic, with the writers often focusing on citation and opinions rather than any practical and useful information. From the 15 or so articles I've read relating to OpenStreetMaps, only two or three have a direct impact on the current usage of community mapping. Moreover, all three articles seem considerably outdated and irrelevant when you compare it with the experience of immersing yourself with mapping software, freely available geospatial tools, and reading community sources.
