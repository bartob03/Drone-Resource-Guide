## Overview

Drones have become not only a popular piece of recreational technology, but an important device for both commercial and public use. From the perspective of the U.S. government, drones fall under the category of *Unmanned Aerial Systems* (UAS) and the term "drone" and "UAS" are generally interchangeable in published government documentation.

This page provides resources for researching drone laws and UAS guidelines. Specifically, they provide links to content from the Federal Aviation Administration and state laws for California and New Jersey. 



## Federal Aviation Administration

The [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov), a component of the U.S. Bureau of Transportation, is the primary agency that releases government information regarding drones and *Unmanned Aerial Systems* (UAS). 

As with most government websites, the FAA website provides a search bar for browsing internal content. It also provides an [A-Z Index](https://www.faa.gov/quick_reference/) page for finding specific information. The most relevant content for drone owners is found on the [UAS](https://www.faa.gov/uas/) page, which covers everything from drone registration, public safety rules, and links to resources such as mobile apps, DroneZone, and the FAA Safety Team website.

The following table lists resources from the FAA, as well as official partner sites that provide information regarding drone regulations.

| Title                                                        | URL/Permalink                                                | Description                                                  |

### FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018

The *FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018* is the primary legislation dealing with UAS integration into U.S. airspace. Although the signing of the bill superficially doesn't affect consumer drone users, it set about further regulation and clarity towards using unmanned aircraft. The Act's text is available through [Congress.gov](https://congress.gov) and can also be viewed through the [Office of the Law Revision Counsel United States Code](https://uscode.house.gov/) website by using the **Popular Name Tool**.

### Federal Register and e-CFR

Due to COVID-19, the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.goc) published an FAA rule describing the role of UAS and UAS pilots during the pandemic. The e-CFR provides the full regulation regarding this ruling in *Title 14: Aeronautics and Space, Part 107 - Small unmanned aircraft systems*.

## National Park Service

Parks and wide areas are a specific concern when it comes to drones. The National Park Service provides some guidance regarding flying UASs in public parks. In most cases however, users will have to verify with local government or with park authorities regarding drone use in specific locations.

| Title                                     | URL/Permalink                                                | Description                                                  |

## State of California resources

### California Department of Transportation 

The [California Department of Transportation](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/4183198866102781150/5092504994866733948#) website provides some resources regarding commercial drone use as well as contact information for inquiries. California's Department of Transportation website doesn't discuss drone use in detail, though it does point to the FAA and provides information regarding using drones for films. Researchers can instead focus on local ordinances or California bills and acts that mention drones.

| **Title**                              | **URL/Permalink**                                            | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Drones)** | https://dot.ca.gov/programs/aeronautics/unmanned-aircraft-systems | Provides links to resources related to UAS use on the state highway and filming projects. |

### California bills and acts 

The [California Legislative Information](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/) website provides bills and codes specific to the state of CA, including those related to drone use. Researchers can use the keyword "drones" or "UAS" in the **Quick Bill Search** and **Quick Code Search** tools to find content related to drones. For a bill search, selecting the session year provides considerably more results.

 The following table lists published active bills and proposed acts related to flying drones in the state. 

| **Title**                                                    | **URL/Permalink**                                            | **Description**                                              |

The bill would also authorize a local agency to adopt regulations to enforce FAA regulations regarding the operation of unmanned aircraft systems and would authorize local agencies to regulate the operation of unmanned aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems within their jurisdictions. The bill would also authorize a local agency to require an unmanned aircraft operator to provide proof of federal, state, or local registration to licensing or enforcement officials. |
| **AB-2787 Unmanned aircraft systems: delivery services**     | http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov:80/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2787& | This bill would require the operator of an unmanned aircraft system involved in an accident resulting in injury to an individual or damage to property to immediately land the unmanned aircraft at the nearest location that will not jeopardize the safety of others. The bill would make a person who knowingly fails to comply with these provisions guilty of an infraction punishable by a fine of not more than $250. |
| **AB-2598 Law enforcement agencies: Federal Bureau of Investigation: Joint Terrorism Task Force.** | http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov:80/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2598& | Defines “Surveillance equipment and technology” as any electronic device or system with the capacity to monitor and collect audio, visual, locational, thermal, or similar information on any individual or group.

### Parks, counties, and ordinances  

Due to the size of the state, researchers will have to visit dedicated websites for specific ordinances and rules for flying drones in parks and counties. These are drone laws that apply only to certain regions, cities, or counties within the state of California, and were created by various authorities within the state.

The following table lists a sampling of restrictions for specific parks and locales in counties all over California.

## State of New Jersey resources

The [New Jersey Legislature](https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/) website provides a comprehensive system for tracking current and passed bills related to drones and UASs. The **Bill Search** includes the option to specify the **Legislative Session** when searching for specific keywords such as "drones" and "UAS". In general, specifying a session returns more results than a general search.

The New Jersey government website, on the other hand, refers to the FAA as the primary source for drone regulations.

| **Title**                        | **URL/Permalink**                                            | **Description**                                              |

## Library of Congress

The [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov) provides two useful references for drone regulations in different countries. The content provides a different perspective to drone use and demonstrates how drone regulation is inconsistent and not universal in its application.
